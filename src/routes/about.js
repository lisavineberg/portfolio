        Hi, I'm Lisa Vineberg, a front end web developer based out of Montreal, Canada. As you can see, this website is very much a work in progress -
        coming up with a design is not my strong suit, so for now, let's stick to the basics.
        I'm always looking to learn more. I'm fluent in English and French, have an intermediate (albeit rusty) level of Hebrew, and a child's level of Polish
        (learning a new language at 30 is tough, but a girl can try!). I volunteer making social calls to isolated seniors, and also as a high school math tutor.
        I love to read, knit, bake, and spend time outside.
